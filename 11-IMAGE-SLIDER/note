When the "next" button is clicked, currentImg is incremented before calling updateImg(). This means that currentImg reflects the index of the next image to be displayed.

However, in the line imageContainerEl.style.transform = translateX(-${(currentImg - 1) * 500}px);, (currentImg - 1) is used to calculate the correct horizontal offset for the image. This is because CSS transform uses a zero-based index for positioning elements, while currentImg starts from 1.

So, subtracting 1 from currentImg ensures that the correct index is used for the image's position calculation, aligning it with the expected behavior of transform and the image indices.

When we calculate translateX(-1 * 500px), it moves the image to the left, not to the right.

The translateX function in CSS moves an element horizontally along the X-axis.

When the value is negative, it moves the element to the left.
When the value is positive, it moves the element to the right.
So, translateX(-500px) moves the image 500 pixels to the left.

In the context of an image slider, this means that the next image in the sequence will appear from the left-hand side of the container, sliding in from left to right.
means the image goes to the right or left-hand side of the container
